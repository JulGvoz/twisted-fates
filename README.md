# Peacebroker
*Peaceful beings and forces of nature. Existing in the realm of the living, they are suddenly disturbed by vile creatures.*

Peacebrokers start on the **good** team. They win when all players on the **evil** team die.
## Zenith
"Each night\*, choose any number of players: if they are on the same team, they cannot die tonight."

**Zenith** can protect players of the same alignment.

- Zenith does not care about character type, only on alignment.
- If a character states that someone dies tonight, players protected by Zenith cannot die from that character.
- If a character states that someone dies tonight and all viable characters are protected by Zenith, nobody can die (this situation doesn't arrive in practice, as there are always at least 2 players not protected).
- Zenith may choose not to act.

## Calamity
"The 1st time you are executed (not the 1st day), all living players die & all dead players come back to life. You stay dead."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/calamity.png" alt="calamity" width="100">

**Calamity** causes living and dead to flip if someone dares to execute them.

- If Calamity is executed during the 1st day, nothing happens, and their ability is used up.
- Calamity's ability can often end in multiple teams dying out. In that case, multiple teams win.
- Calamity being executed while dead does nothing, since they have no ability while dead.

## Elixir
"You cannot die from execution if you were nominated by a fated."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/calamity.png" alt="calamity" width="100">

**Elixir** is protected from fated alignment players during executions.

- If a good or evil Fatebound nominated and executed them, Elixir's ability does not trigger.
- If fated Vile or Peacebroker nominated and executed them, Elixir is executed but does not die.

## Sleepwalker
"You do not know you are a Peacebroker. You think that you are either Vile or Fatebound."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/sleepwalker.png" alt="sleepwalker" width="100">

- During setup, the Sleepwalker's token does not go in the bag. Instead, a Vile or Fatebound character goes in the bag (Your choice), and the player who draws that token is secretly the Sleepwalker for the whole game. You know. They do not.
- If you put an extra Vile token, the Sleepwalker must be a Vile. Accordingly with Fatebound.
- Sleepwalker has no ability. Whenever their Vile or Fatebound ability would affect the game in some way, it doesn't. However, you pretend that they are the character they think they are. If that character would wake at night, wake the Sleepwalker instead and act as if they were that character. If that character would gain information, you may give them false information instead - and you're encouraged to do so.
- The Sleepwalker begins thinking they are evil (if given a Vile token) or fated (if given a Fatebound token). If their ability can change their alignment, you may lie to them about their new alignment.
- If the Sleepwalker thinks their ability couldn't modify their alignment, you cannot lie to them about their alignment other than them thinking that they are their normal starting alignment. If they think they are Vile (and evil), and they turn evil, do not notify them of an alignment change (accordingly with Fatefound and fated). If they would turn good, tell them they became good.
- You may give explicit indication that Sleepwalker is the Sleepwalker through their information.

# Vile
## Cutthroat
"Each night\*, choose a player who was nominated today: they die."
## Savage
"Each night\*, choose a player: if they are not on the same team as last executee, they die."
## Wanton
"Each night\*, if an evil player nominated today, all non-evil players are poisoned tonight. Otherwise, a player dies tonight."
## Neolith
"Each night, mark a living unmarked player. If a marked player dies, all marked players are poisoned until dusk. Otherwise, a player dies tonight."
# Fatebound
## Weaver
"You start knowing the entire Grimoire. Players of your alignment register falsely to you in the Grimoire you see."
## Seeker
You start knowing a player & their alignment. When the player you know dies, you learn another.
## Mangler
"Each night\*, choose 2 players (not yourself): they swap alignments."
## Apostle
"Each night\*, you become the alignment of the 1st player who nominated. If you win & you are not fated, you become fated and lose instead."
