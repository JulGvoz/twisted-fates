# Peacebroker
*Peaceful beings and forces of nature. Existing in the realm of the living, they are suddenly disturbed by vile creatures.*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bra1n/townsquare/main/src/assets/icons/good.png" alt="good" width="150">

Peacebrokers start on the **good** team. They win when all players on the **evil** team die.
## Zenith
"Each night\*, choose any number of players: if they are on the same team, they cannot die tonight."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/zenith.png" alt="zenith" width="100">

**Zenith** can protect players of the same alignment.

- Zenith does not care about character type, only on alignment.
- If a character states that someone dies tonight, players protected by Zenith cannot die from that character.
- If a character states that someone dies tonight and all viable characters are protected by Zenith, nobody can die (this situation doesn't arrive in practice, as there are always at least 2 players not protected).
- Zenith may choose not to act.

## Calamity
"The 1st time you are executed (not the 1st day), all living players die & all dead players come back to life. You stay dead."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/calamity.png" alt="calamity" width="100">

**Calamity** causes living and dead to flip if someone dares to execute them.

- If Calamity is executed during the 1st day, nothing happens, and their ability is used up.
- Calamity's ability can often end in multiple teams dying out. In that case, multiple teams win.
- Calamity being executed while dead does nothing, since they have no ability while dead.

## Elixir
"You cannot die from execution if you were nominated by a fated."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/elixir.png" alt="elixir" width="100">

**Elixir** is protected from fated alignment players during executions.

- If a good or evil Fatebound nominated and executed them, Elixir's ability does not trigger.
- If fated Vile or Peacebroker nominated and executed them, Elixir is executed but does not die.

## Sleepwalker
"You do not know you are a Peacebroker. You think that you are either Vile or Fatebound."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/sleepwalker.png" alt="sleepwalker" width="100">

- During setup, the Sleepwalker's token does not go in the bag. Instead, a Vile or Fatebound character goes in the bag (Your choice), and the player who draws that token is secretly the Sleepwalker for the whole game. You know. They do not.
- If you put an extra Vile token, the Sleepwalker must be a Vile. Accordingly with Fatebound.
- Sleepwalker has no ability. Whenever their Vile or Fatebound ability would affect the game in some way, it doesn't. However, you pretend that they are the character they think they are. If that character would wake at night, wake the Sleepwalker instead and act as if they were that character. If that character would gain information, you may give them false information instead - and you're encouraged to do so.
- The Sleepwalker begins thinking they are evil (if given a Vile token) or fated (if given a Fatebound token). If their ability can change their alignment, you may lie to them about their new alignment.
- If the Sleepwalker thinks their ability couldn't modify their alignment, you cannot lie to them about their alignment other than them thinking that they are their normal starting alignment. If they think they are Vile (and evil), and they turn evil, do not notify them of an alignment change (accordingly with Fatefound and fated). If they would turn good, tell them they became good.
- You may give explicit indication that Sleepwalker is the Sleepwalker through their information.

# Vile

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bra1n/townsquare/main/src/assets/icons/evil.png" alt="evil" width="150">

## Cutthroat
"Each night\*, choose a player who was nominated today: they die."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/cutthroat.png" alt="cutthroat" width="100">

**Cutthroat** threathens and scares people into nominating after being nominated by the fear of death.

- If nobody was nominated today, Cutthroat does not wake tonight.
- Cutthroat may choose a dead player if a dead player was nominated.

## Savage
"Each night\*, choose a player: if they are not on the same team as last executee, they die."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/savage.png" alt="savage" width="100">

**Savage** equalizes the game, by killing players of different alignements than those that were executed today.

- Savage wakes each night starting with 2nd night, and chooses a player.
- When a player is executed, place the "Last executee" reminder token near them.
- If nobody was executed today, the "Last executee" token remains on the last player.
- If nobody was executed in the game yet, Savage can kill anyone.

## Wanton
"Each night\*, if an evil player nominated today, all non-evil players are poisoned tonight. Otherwise, a player dies tonight."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/wanton.png" alt="wanton" width="100">

**Wanton** seduces fellow evils in order to poison players, or rages if they weren't successful.

- If no evil player nominated today, the Storyteller choses a living player who can die today to die.
- Wanton only cares about alignment, not character type.

## Neolith
"Each night, mark a living unmarked player. If a marked player dies, all marked players are poisoned until dusk. Otherwise, a player dies tonight."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/neolith.png" alt="neolith" width="100">

**Neolith** slowly marks living players, unleashing a surprise attack and wounding them if they show any weakness.

- Players remain marked even if they die.
- Marked players are poisoned only when Neolith acts during the night.
- If a marked player died since Neolith acted, the next time Neolith acts, marked players, including the brand new marked player, are poisoned.

# Fatebound
*Forthbringers of progress, these humans have discovered a way of tampering with fate, thus embedding themselves in it. Now they have a mission of bringing down the natural order and instilling purity into the world.*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/fated.png" alt="fated" width="100">

## Weaver
"You start knowing the entire Grimoire. Players of your alignment register falsely to you in the Grimoire you see."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/weaver.png" alt="weaver" width="100">

**Weaver** knows the fate of all but their own.

- Before showing the Grimoire to Weaver, the Storyteller must save the real grimoire (taking a screenshot or a photo. It is often useful to do this even if Weaver is not in play), show a modified Grimoire, and then restore the Grimoire.
- All Fatebound characters **must** be replaced with Vile or Peacebroker characters.
- If there is a Sleepwalker who thinks that they are Fatebound, Weaver sees the Fatebound character with the "Sleepwalker" reminder token next to them.
- Duplicate or paper tokens may be required, as the Weaver could see duplicate tokens. 
- Weaver's teammates can register as Sleepwalkers too. In that case, either the original Fatebound character or any other character can be shown.
- Weaver should not see alignment tokens next to characters.

## Seeker
You start knowing a player & their alignment. When the player you know dies, you learn another.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/seeker.png" alt="seeker" width="100">

**Seeker** searches for a person who's fate they can accept... killing all the others in the process. They always know the alignment of a player, and each time the player they know dies, they learn another.

- The Storyteller can show the Seeker themselves (not recommended).
- Seeker only wakes if the player who they knew died before them during night or day.
- If Seeker would die tonight, they cannot learn another player.
- If the player Seeker knows changes alignment, Seeker does not learn this.

## Mangler
"Each night\*, choose 2 players (not yourself): they swap alignments."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/mangler.png" alt="mangler" width="100">

**Mangler** twists people's fates, tangling them in a web.

- After Mangler makes their choice, if the players they chose have different alignments, wake each of them separately and tell them of their alignment change.
- If Mangler causes all players of a team to become dead, the game ends.
- If Mangler chooses 2 players of the same alignment, nothing happens.


## Apostle
"Each night\*, you become the alignment of the 1st player who nominated today. When the game ends, you become fated."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JulGvoz/twisted-fates/master/original-icons/apostle.png" alt="apostle" width="100">

**Apostle** carries out their mission at any cost.

- If Apostle dies as good or evil, they will stay good or evil even if game ends.
- If the game ends with good or evil winning, Apostle turns fated and loses instead.
- Apostle turning fated due to game ending cannot continue the game.
- If Apostle would win, but turns fated, they lose, unless all good are dead too.
- If Apostle is the last remaining player of a team and die, they remain that alignment.
- If Apostle is the last remaining player of a team and changes alignement, game ends and then apostle turns fated.
